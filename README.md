# Analysis of the Kepler Certified False Positive Table

The file cfpTable.csv contains Kepler certified false positive table merged with the Kepler Cumulative KOI table and the Kepler DR25 stellar properties table.  The columns in the table are labeled with the same labels as in the exoplanet archive.  This table is current as of September 2019.  A large update of the certified false positive table is expected around Oct 1 2019, and the table will be regenerated at that time.

The python notebook examineCfpTable.ipynb gives simple examples of how to analyze the table.

The original tables are found at the NASA Exoplanet Archive at https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu (select Data then the desired table).  See the documentation on the archive for details on the contents of the tables.
